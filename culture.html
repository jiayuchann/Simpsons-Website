						Springfield is home to people of many races, cultures, including European-Americans, African-Americans, Latinos, South Asians and East Asians.<br><br>

						Springfield residents actually have quite the bad reputation. According to Dr. Hibbert, "it is a town where the smartest have no power and the stupidest run everything". A fairly accurate statement according to an unnamed Shelbyville ressident. The offices of the police chief and mayor were also found out to be run by clearly incompetent and corrupt individuals, and those few who are competent in official positions are soon replaced by other incompetents.<br><br>

						Even TIME magazine even did a cover story on Springfield titled "America's Worst City,". Newsweek has also referred to the city as "America's Crap Bucket," the town actually has a signbaord saying that it is the "Meanest town in America." Most of it's citizens are very stupid, overweight, and also quick to anger, though according to a few Springfield residents, Shelbyville residents are even stupider and more backward than Springfield residents.

						Religion and faith actually plays a large role in Springfieldian society as the largest church community appears to be the First Church of Springfield. It is a Presbylutheran church headed by Timothy Lovejoy. There is also a synagogue which is led by Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky, a mosque, a Catholic church which is called The Notre Dame of Springfield, the Cathedral of the Downtown, a crystal cathedral, and a Buddhist temple. And a resident in Springfield called Apu was actually found to have a statue of the Ganesh in the Kwik-E-Mart.

					Springfield is located in an area of the country that receives plenty of rain and snow. Although, most of the time the skies are blue and mostly sunny. Springfield also has quite a number of recorded natural disasters such as avalanches, earthquakes, acid rain, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, lightning strikes, and volcanic eruptions. And as Springfield is situated in a valley, Springfield has a humid-subtropical climate. When visitors first arrive into Springfield, they are advised to constantly wear radiation suits and carry Geiger counters, as the city is perhaps the most radioactive in the U.S. This is because the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's nuclear core is surrounded by ordinary plaster with a horseshoe hanging from a nail and not several layers of protective concrete and graphite. The power plant was built when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were very lax on the rules and regualtions. Current employees are even encouraged by the management to store  nuclear waste in buildings for extra benefits.

						There are quite a lot of prisons in Springfield, including Springfield Penitentiary, Springwood Minimum Security Prison, Springfield Women's Prison, Springfield Juvenile Correctional Facility, Morningwood Penitentiary and Montgomery Burns State Penitentiary and more. Fun fact, Springfield Elementary School was even once semi-converted into a prison. Police Chief Wiggum who commands the The Springfield Police Department, is actually largely corrupt and as a whole the police force is an incompetent organization.According to police chief Wiggum, they only have plenty of manpower to enforce the last three laws that were passed.
