Apply all the fundamental knowledge gathered across the semester( HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, PHP, databases and security) to the design, implementation, and presentation of a final project.

Instructions
- Ideally, your final project will be an extension and transformation of the website you developed for your midterm project.
- You will code your website and upload it to a free web hosting service such as www.000webhost.com, www.awardspace.com, or webfreehosting.net. If you want to use a different web hosting service, make sure it allows you to use databases and PHP. If you choose to buy a web hosting service such as  www.hostinger.com, www.a2hosting.com, you can also do that (some places allow you to pay monthly).
- Design and test your database on the web hosting of your choice. 
- Make sure to perform extensive testing of your website, so you can find and fix as many bugs as possible before the presentation date.
- Your project should implement a responsive design in which your website adapts to the different output media (smartphone, tablets, laptops, desktops, and so on).
- Keep it simple and do not overwhelm yourselves, make sure the basics are covered before starting miscellaneous features.

Technologies and Concepts

Each team will make use of the technologies explained in class, as well as Internet resources and the course book to complete the final project. Such technologies are:
- HTML5
- CSS and Bootstrap
- JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX
- PHP
- MySQL Database.

Project Requirements (schedule, weight)
The following are the requirements for this project:
- Overall, your website should have a name, a simple logo, and follow a design theme. Develop features appropriate to the design theme of your website. Your website need to look visually pleasing and intuitive for the users. Your website should implement a responsive design. Make the best use of the Bootstrap framework and CSS Design. (week 1-5 HTML/CSS, 20%)
- Use javascript and/or jQuery, to make your webpages both dynamic and interactive by performing client-side tasks like: (1) adding event listeners to user actions to dynamically display or change, add or delete your web contents; (2) adding animations to your website. (week 6-9 Javascript and jQuery, 35%)
- Upload your website to a web hosting service, so that your website can be accessed by typing an URL. Your website should have a Landing Page (named index.php) which is the first page the non-registered users will see after typing the URL for your website. (week 10 PHP 1, 20%)
- Use PHP and database technologies (MySQL) to handle user requests from the server-side by dynamically display, or add, change or delete some of your web contents. (week 10-12 PHP and Databases, 15%) 
- Add any one from the following three features to your website: (week 4-14, 10%) 
  - error handling (e.g., form validation and error handling)
  - web security (e.g., user authentication)
  - Integrate some form of web service or API, such as: 
    - Google Maps: To show the location in a map, for a user.
    - Weather: To show the weather for a userâ€™s location.

BONUS Projects that go above and beyond the project requirements listed above could receive extra credits from extra 1% up to 20% if they could:
- Demonstrate mastery and outstanding implementation of HTML 5,  CSS 3, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.
- Use of AJAX for asynchronous server requests.
